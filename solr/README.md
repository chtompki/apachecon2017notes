Solr 9a 5/18.
=============

### What is solr?

* Faceted search

### Graph traversal.

* Directed graphs with properties on labels of both edges and vertices
* Take both vertices and edges treat them as "documents" in solr and the search engine.
* Search engines work best on "maps" or key-value pairs or "properties"

### Graph filter.

* maxDepth
* traversalFilter
* returnRoot
* leafNodesOnly

### Streaming expressions.

This stuff is really interesting in applied graph theory.
